# Cloud Threat Modeling Repository

Welcome to the **Cloud Threat Modeling Repository**, a centralized collection of threat models, risk assessments, and mitigation strategies for major cloud platforms including **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository provides:

- **Comprehensive threat models** tailored to AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.
- Clear documentation of **system architecture**, **trust boundaries**, and **key assets**.
- Detailed **threat identification** using the STRIDE framework.
- **Risk assessment** based on likelihood and impact with DREAD scoring.
- Practical **mitigation strategies** mapped to identified risks.
- Tracking of **open issues** and known security gaps.
- Templates for a **basic threat model**, **STRIDE tables**, and **risk assessment frameworks** applicable across cloud providers.

## üìö How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the folder for your cloud provider of interest (`aws/`, `azure/`, or `gcp/`).
2. Start with the `README.md` in that folder for a summary of scope and objectives.
3. Review the **system overview** and **assets** documents to understand the environment.
4. Study the **trust boundaries** to identify security zones.
5. Explore the **threat identification** and **risk assessment** documents to understand vulnerabilities and prioritize risks.
6. Check out **mitigation strategies** and **open issues** for actionable guidance.
7. Refer to the root-level templates for generic threat modeling concepts applicable across clouds.
8. Use the `diagrams/` folder for visual context of cloud architecture with trust boundaries.
