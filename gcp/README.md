# ☁️ Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Threat Modeling

This directory contains a comprehensive threat model tailored to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments. It is designed to help identify, assess, and mitigate security risks specific to GCP services and architecture.

---

## 📘 Scope

This threat model covers common GCP services such as:

- Google Cloud Identity & Access Management (IAM)  
- Google Compute Engine (GCE)  
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS)  
- Google Cloud Functions  
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  
- Cloud Pub/Sub and BigQuery  
- VPC Networking, Firewall Rules, and Cloud Armor  
- Cloud Logging, Monitoring, and Security Command Center
