# AWS Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries define the zones within the AWS environment where different levels of trust apply. They help identify where data and control flow cross security boundaries and where controls need to be enforced.

## 1. Trust Zones and Boundaries

| Trust Zone                         | Description                                                      | Examples / AWS Services                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Public Internet**                | Untrusted external network                                       | User browsers, external clients         |
| **AWS Edge Network**               | AWS global network edge for content delivery                    | Amazon CloudFront CDN                    |
| **Application Frontend**           | Public-facing web and API entry points                           | S3 Website Hosting, API Gateway         |
| **Authentication Boundary**       | Identity verification and token issuance zone                   | AWS Cognito User Pools                   |
| **Backend Compute Layer**          | Serverless and compute resources executing business logic       | AWS Lambda, EC2 Instances                |
| **Data Storage and Databases**    | Persistent storage and data services                             | S3 Buckets, DynamoDB, RDS                |
| **Management & Monitoring Zone**  | Infrastructure management, audit, and monitoring                 | CloudTrail, CloudWatch, IAM Console     |
| **Network Boundary (VPC)**         | Isolated network segments with controlled access                | VPC Subnets, Security Groups, NACLs     |
| **CI/CD Pipeline Environment**    | Development and deployment workflows                             | AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild              |

## 2. Typical Trust Boundary Crossings

| Boundary Crossing                              | Description                                           | Security Controls / Mitigations                   |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **User ⇄ Frontend**                             | External users access web app or APIs                  | TLS Encryption, WAF, Rate Limiting                |
| **Frontend ⇄ Backend Compute**                  | API Gateway triggers Lambda or EC2                      | IAM Roles, API Keys, Authorization tokens        |
| **Backend ⇄ Data Storage**                       | Compute resources read/write data in storage services  | IAM Policies, Encryption at rest and in transit  |
| **CI/CD ⇄ Production Environment**              | Deployment pipelines push code/config changes          | IAM Roles, Approval Gates, MFA                     |
| **Monitoring & Audit ⇄ Managed Services**       | Logging and monitoring data access                       | Restricted IAM access, encryption                  |

## 4. Summary

- Trust boundaries highlight where untrusted data or actors interact with your environment.
- Enforcing strict access controls, encryption, and monitoring at these boundaries is critical.
- Regularly review trust boundaries as your AWS architecture evolves.
