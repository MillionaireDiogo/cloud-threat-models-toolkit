# ☁️ AWS Threat Modeling

This section provides a detailed threat model for cloud systems and workloads hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It follows a structured, cloud-native approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks based on STRIDE and DREAD methodologies.

---

## 📘 Scope

This threat model focuses on common AWS resources, services, and architectural components such as:

- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- EC2 Instances and Auto Scaling Groups
- S3 Buckets and Data Lakes
- API Gateway, Lambda Functions
- RDS/Aurora Databases
- CloudTrail, CloudWatch
- VPC, Security Groups, and Networking

## 📊 Methodologies Used

- **STRIDE** for categorizing threats  
- **DREAD** for risk scoring and prioritization  
- **Architecture Diagrams** for visualizing system components  
- **Cloud-Native Security Features** (e.g., IAM, Security Groups, CloudTrail)

## 📎 Usage

1. Review each section and tailor to your specific AWS architecture.
2. Replace placeholder values with actual services, roles, and configurations.
3. Use this as a living document — update it as your AWS environment evolves.

## 🎯 Goal

To provide security engineers, cloud architects, and compliance teams with a practical, extensible threat model for evaluating the security posture of AWS-hosted applications and systems.

> 📌 *This model supports proactive cloud security, not reactive firefighting.*
