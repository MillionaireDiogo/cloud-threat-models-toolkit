# AWS System Overview

## 1. System Name
ExampleCloudApp

## 2. Description
ExampleCloudApp is a scalable web application hosted on AWS designed to deliver content and services to end users globally. It incorporates a microservices architecture using serverless and managed services to optimize cost, performance, and security.

## 3. Architecture Overview
The system consists of the following components:

- **Frontend:**  
  Static web content served via Amazon S3 and distributed globally through Amazon CloudFront CDN.

- **API Layer:**  
  RESTful APIs hosted on Amazon API Gateway, which trigger AWS Lambda functions for business logic processing.

- **Compute:**  
  Lambda functions perform core application logic and integrate with backend services.

- **Data Storage:**  
  - Amazon DynamoDB for fast, scalable NoSQL data storage.  
  - Amazon S3 for object storage (user uploads, logs, backups).  
  - Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for relational data.

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  AWS Cognito manages user identities, authentication, and access tokens.

- **Networking & Security:**  
  - AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) isolates backend resources.  
  - Security Groups and Network ACLs control traffic flow.  
  - AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) protects APIs from common web exploits.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  CloudWatch monitors application metrics and triggers alerts.  
  AWS CloudTrail logs API activity for audit and compliance.

## 4. Business Objectives
- Provide a highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable platform for customers.  
- Protect sensitive user data and comply with industry security standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).  
- Enable rapid feature deployment via CI/CD pipelines integrated with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild.
