# AWS Threat Model - Open Issues and Future Concerns

This document highlights unresolved risks, gaps, and areas needing further analysis or mitigation in the AWS environment.

---

## 1. Unaddressed or Emerging Threats

- **Insider Threat Detection:**  
  Current monitoring may not fully detect malicious activity by privileged insiders.

- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT):**  
  Sophisticated, targeted attacks remain a concern beyond baseline controls.

- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  
  Potential unknown exploits in AWS managed services or custom applications.

---

## 2. Configuration and Policy Gaps

- **Incomplete IAM Role Auditing:**  
  Some IAM roles may have overly broad permissions not yet reviewed.

- **Publicly Accessible Resources:**  
  Possible exposure of S3 buckets or RDS instances due to misconfigurations.

- **Incomplete MFA Enforcement:**  
  MFA is not yet enforced on all accounts with elevated privileges.

---

## 3. Monitoring and Response

- **Alert Fatigue:**  
  High volume of alerts may cause critical events to be overlooked.

- **Insufficient Log Retention:**  
  Retention period for CloudTrail and CloudWatch logs may not meet compliance requirements.

- **Limited Automation in Incident Response:**  
  Many response actions are still manual, delaying mitigation.

---

## 4. Scalability and Resilience Concerns

- **Denial of Service Preparedness:**  
  Current DoS mitigation strategies may not handle large-scale or novel attacks.

- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**  
  Backups of critical data and configurations require regular testing.

---

## 5. Future Enhancements

- **Implement Continuous Compliance Checks:**  
  Automate policy enforcement using AWS Config rules and Security Hub integrations.

- **Expand Use of AWS GuardDuty and Detective:**  
  Enhance threat detection and investigation capabilities.

- **Conduct Regular Penetration Testing:**  
  Identify vulnerabilities and validate mitigations periodically.

- **Security Training and Awareness:**  
  Improve user and developer awareness to reduce risk from social engineering.
