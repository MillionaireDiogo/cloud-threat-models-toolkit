# Azure Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries delineate zones within Azure where different levels of trust apply. Understanding these boundaries helps enforce security controls where data or control flows cross trust zones.

## 1. Trust Zones and Boundaries

| Trust Zone                     | Description                                               | Examples / Azure Services                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Public Internet**            | Untrusted external network                                | User browsers, external clients                |
| **Azure Edge Network**         | Microsoft’s global CDN edge for content delivery          | Azure CDN                                     |
| **Application Frontend**       | Public-facing web applications and API entry points       | Azure Blob Storage static websites, APIM      |
| **Authentication Boundary**   | Identity verification and token issuance zone             | Azure Active Directory (AAD)                   |
| **Backend Compute Layer**      | Serverless and compute resources processing business logic | Azure Functions, Azure App Service             |
| **Data Storage and Databases**| Persistent storage services                                | Azure Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL DB   |
| **Management & Monitoring Zone** | Infrastructure management and monitoring                   | Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center           |
| **Network Boundary (VNet)**    | Isolated network segments with controlled access          | Virtual Network (VNet), Network Security Groups (NSGs) |
| **CI/CD Pipeline Environment**| Development and deployment workflows                       | Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions                    |

## 2. Typical Trust Boundary Crossings

| Boundary Crossing                       | Description                                  | Security Controls / Mitigations                |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **User ⇄ Frontend**                     | External users access web app or APIs        | TLS encryption, WAF, rate limiting             |
| **Frontend ⇄ Backend Compute**          | API Management invokes Functions or App Service | Managed identities, OAuth tokens, RBAC        |
| **Backend ⇄ Data Storage**               | Compute accesses storage or databases        | RBAC, encryption at rest and in transit        |
| **CI/CD ⇄ Production Environment**      | Pipeline deploys code/configurations          | Approval gates, MFA, RBAC                       |
| **Monitoring & Audit ⇄ Managed Services** | Access to logs and telemetry data             | Restricted access, encryption                   |

## 4. Summary

- Trust boundaries identify where untrusted data or actors interact with your Azure environment.  
- Security controls such as access management, encryption, and monitoring must be enforced at these boundaries.  
- Regularly revisit trust boundaries as your Azure infrastructure evolves.
