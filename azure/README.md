# ☁️ Azure Threat Modeling

This section contains a comprehensive threat model tailored to Microsoft Azure cloud environments. It aims to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks specific to Azure services and architecture using industry-standard methodologies.

---

## 📘 Scope

This threat model focuses on common Azure resources and services such as:

- Azure Active Directory (AAD)
- Azure Virtual Machines and Scale Sets
- Azure Blob Storage and Files
- Azure Functions and App Services
- Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB
- Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Firewalls

## 📊 Methodologies Used

- **STRIDE** for threat categorization  
- **DREAD** for risk assessment and prioritization  
- Architecture diagrams to visualize trust boundaries and data flows  
- Leveraging Azure-native security controls and best practices
