# Azure Mitigations & Security Controls

This document outlines key mitigations to reduce risks identified in the Azure environment, leveraging Azure-native features and best practices.

---

## 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **Implement Least Privilege Access:**  
  Assign only necessary permissions through Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

- **Use Managed Identities:**  
  Avoid managing credentials by leveraging Azure Managed Identities for service authentication.

- **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
  Require MFA for all privileged accounts, especially those with global administrator roles.

- **Conditional Access Policies:**  
  Use Azure AD Conditional Access to enforce contextual access controls.

- **Regularly Review and Audit Access:**  
  Continuously monitor permissions and remove unused accounts or roles.

---

## 2. Data Protection

- **Encrypt Data At Rest:**  
  Use Azure Storage Service Encryption, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for databases.

- **Encrypt Data In Transit:**  
  Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all communication.

- **Secure Blob Storage Access:**  
  Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS) with limited permissions and expiry.

- **Enable Immutable Storage for Critical Data:**  
  Protect data from tampering and deletion using Azure Blob immutable storage.

---

## 3. Network Security

- **Use Virtual Networks (VNets) and Subnets:**  
  Isolate resources and apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict traffic.

- **Azure Firewall and DDoS Protection:**  
  Deploy managed firewall services and enable DDoS Protection Standard.

- **Private Endpoints:**  
  Access PaaS services over private IP addresses to avoid exposure to the internet.

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  
  Protect web applications from common attacks via Azure Front Door or Application Gateway.

---

## 4. Monitoring and Logging

- **Enable Azure Monitor and Log Analytics:**  
  Collect and analyze logs, metrics, and alerts.

- **Use Azure Security Center:**  
  Assess security posture and receive recommendations.

- **Enable Diagnostic Settings:**  
  Stream logs to storage accounts, event hubs, or SIEM solutions.

- **Set Up Automated Alerts:**  
  Notify relevant teams of suspicious or critical activities.

---

## 5. Secure Development and Deployment

- **Integrate Security into Azure DevOps Pipelines:**  
  Include static code analysis, dependency checks, and security tests.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  
  Use ARM templates, Bicep, or Terraform with security scanning tools.

- **Regular Security Reviews:**  
  Conduct code and configuration reviews focused on security.

---

## 6. Incident Response

- **Develop and Maintain Incident Response Plans:**  
  Define roles, responsibilities, and procedures.

- **Automate Response Actions:**  
  Use Azure Logic Apps or Functions for automated mitigation where feasible.

- **Conduct Regular Drills:**  
  Test incident response plans with tabletop exercises and simulations.

---

## 7. Additional Best Practices

- **Regular Security Assessments and Penetration Testing:**  
  Identify vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Leverage Azure Security Center Recommendations:**  
  Continuously improve security posture.

- **Implement Guardrails with Azure Policy:**  
  Enforce organizational standards and compliance requirements.
