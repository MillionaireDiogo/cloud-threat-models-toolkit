# Azure Threat Model â€“ Open Issues and Future Concerns

This document highlights unresolved risks, gaps, and areas requiring further analysis or mitigation in the Azure environment.

---

## 1. Unaddressed or Emerging Threats

- **Insider Threat Detection:**  
  Monitoring for malicious activities by privileged insiders is limited.

- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT):**  
  Sophisticated targeted attacks may evade existing controls.

- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  
  Unknown vulnerabilities in Azure services or custom applications.

---

## 2. Configuration and Policy Gaps

- **Incomplete RBAC Reviews:**  
  Some roles may have excessive permissions not yet audited.

- **Publicly Accessible Resources:**  
  Potential exposure of Blob Storage containers or SQL databases due to misconfigurations.

- **Incomplete MFA Enforcement:**  
  MFA not enforced on all privileged accounts.

---

## 3. Monitoring and Response

- **Alert Fatigue:**  
  High volume of alerts can lead to missed critical events.

- **Log Retention and Integrity:**  
  Log retention periods may not meet compliance; ensuring log immutability is a concern.

- **Limited Automation in Incident Response:**  
  Manual response procedures delay remediation.

---

## 4. Scalability and Resilience Concerns

- **DoS Preparedness:**  
  Current defenses may not withstand large or novel DDoS attacks.

- **Backup and Disaster Recovery Testing:**  
  Backups exist but are not regularly tested for restore capability.

---

## 5. Future Enhancements

- **Continuous Compliance Monitoring:**  
  Automate policy enforcement using Azure Policy and Security Center.

- **Expand Use of Azure Sentinel:**  
  Improve threat detection and response.

- **Regular Penetration Testing:**  
  Identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Security Awareness Training:**  
  Increase awareness to reduce risks from social engineering.
